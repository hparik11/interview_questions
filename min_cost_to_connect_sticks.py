Given n ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. We can connect only 2 ropes at a time. The cost required to connect 2 ropes is equal to sum of their lengths. The length of this connected rope is also equal to the sum of their lengths. This process is repeated until n ropes are connected into a single rope. Find the min possible cost required to connect all ropes.

Example 1:

Input: ropes = [8, 4, 6, 12]
Output: 58
Explanation: The optimal way to connect ropes is as follows
1. Connect the ropes of length 4 and 6 (cost is 10). Ropes after connecting: [8, 10, 12]
2. Connect the ropes of length 8 and 10 (cost is 18). Ropes after connecting: [18, 12]
3. Connect the ropes of length 18 and 12 (cost is 30).
Total cost to connect the ropes is 10 + 18 + 30 = 58
Example 2:

Input: ropes = [20, 4, 8, 2]
Output: 54
Example 3:

Input: ropes = [1, 2, 5, 10, 35, 89]
Output: 224
Example 4:

Input: ropes = [2, 2, 3, 3]
Output: 20

You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array sticks, where sticks[i] is the length of the ith stick.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths x and y into one stick by paying a cost of x + y. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.



Example 1:

Input: sticks = [2,4,3]
Output: 14
Explanation: You start with sticks = [2,4,3].
1. Combine sticks 2 and 3 for a cost of 2 + 3 = 5. Now you have sticks = [5,4].
2. Combine sticks 5 and 4 for a cost of 5 + 4 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9].
There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 5 + 9 = 14.
Example 2:

Input: sticks = [1,8,3,5]
Output: 30
Explanation: You start with sticks = [1,8,3,5].
1. Combine sticks 1 and 3 for a cost of 1 + 3 = 4. Now you have sticks = [4,8,5].
2. Combine sticks 4 and 5 for a cost of 4 + 5 = 9. Now you have sticks = [9,8].
3. Combine sticks 9 and 8 for a cost of 9 + 8 = 17. Now you have sticks = [17].
There is only one stick left, so you are done. The total cost is 4 + 9 + 17 = 30.
Example 3:

Input: sticks = [5]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is only one stick, so you don't need to do anything. The total cost is 0.
