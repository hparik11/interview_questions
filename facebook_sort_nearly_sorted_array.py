Sort a nearly sorted (or K sorted) array
Difficulty Level : Medium
Last Updated : 12 Aug, 2021

Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position, devise an algorithm that sorts in O(n log k) time. For example, let us consider k is 2, an element at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given array.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {6, 5, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9}
            k = 3
Output : arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}

Input : arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 4, 70, 60, 50}
         k = 4
Output : arr[] = {4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 50, 60, 70}
